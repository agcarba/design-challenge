# DocNetwork Design Challenge

In this challenge, you'll be recreating a website of your choice. It's a pretty open-ended challenge, so have fun and showcase your code and creativity.

## What do I do?
- Pick a website
- Recreate it

## No, seriously, what do I do?
Your task is to choose the homepage of a popular website, and recreate a single page site using HTML5 and CSS3. You can recreate one of the sites below, or choose a different website. It's a big internet out there.

Once you've chosen a website to build, fork this repository on GitHub. If you don't have a GitHub account already, go make one. Trust me, you'll want one in the long run.

After forking this repository, add your code to recreate your site. Feel free to modify/remove the template files, and separate your site into whatever directory structure you want (just please don't minify your code; we kind of want to review it when you're done).

When finished, edit the `Solution Discussion` section of this README file below. Answer a couple basic questions on your work, and commit your project to Github.

Once you've finished everything and are at least a little proud of your work, submit a pull request to the `docnetwork/design-challenge` repo. We'll take a look at your code and get back to you.


## Things to consider
- **Be Vanilla**  
While we love that you know
Bootstrap/Angular/React/hipstr.js, we're really trying to evaluate your understanding of vanilla web technologies. I know how cool they are, but please avoid using any frameworks.  

- **Don't Cheat**  
Don't scrape a site and pass it as your own code. It's stupid easy to spot, and a surefire way to not get a job.

- **Don't use Dreamweaver/WordPress/WYSIWYGarbage**   Just don't.

- **It doesn't need to be pixel perfect.**  
We don't care if the padding is off. We don't care that you used `#ffffff` instead of `#fefefe`. Just keep your code clean and make it look good.

- **It doesn't need functionality**  
The links don't have to go anywhere. The text can be lorem ipsum if you _really_ want. This is an informal design challenge.

- **It's okay if you get stuck**   
We value good communication skills. If you get stuck and can't finish the challenge, don't be afraid to submit it. You won't automatically be disqualified, just tell us why you couldn't finish, and what the next steps are to overcome the issue.

## Extra Credit
- Use HTML5 semantic tags
- Use CSS3 features where appropriate
- Make your site responsive
- Add JavaScript if you're feeling frisky

#### But I'm a programmer, not a designer!
Well don't whine about it! We're looking for software developers who have varied skillsets and are able to adapt to new technologies. Don't worry, we have plenty of software engineering challenges, on both the Front-End and the Back-End. But if you're a _super-rockstar-ninja-guru_ and already finished this challenge, go check out our [AngularJS challenge](https://github.com/docnetwork/angular-challenge) for something a little more algorithmic.


## Solution Discussion
**Answer these questions before submitting your pull request!**
Why did you choose the website you did?
  I chose www.docnetworks.com because it looked like it would be challenging without biting off more than I could chew. It has a relatively simple layout without any pop-out menus or images that float around and change by themselves over time; however, it has images and links and a layout that would require organization and knowledge of how to organize and structure webpages. Having to approximate the font, background colors, insert linked images, and have the several sections of the webpage organized in the correct way seemed challenging without being overwhelming. Of course, I did not choose this webpage without some desire to suck-up, but overall it did seem like a good medium between simple and challenging, so that I could demonstrate my knoweldge of HTML/CSS at an achievable level of difficulty.
  
What challenges did you face while building your site?
  I did not really know any HTML or CSS when I began this challenge. I have experience with computer programming, but little with web development. I began this project by going through the Codecademy course on HTML and CSS, then when I felt ready I began to actually design the webpage. So challenges faced included learning a significant amount of HTML and CSS, figuring out how to extrapolate what I learned from Codecademy and from extensive Google searches to be able to structure my code to get the webpage I was aiming for. At this point my webpage functions correctly, insofar as the links go to the right places, it contains the correct images, and all the information is complete and accurate. However I find it to be much less aesthetically pleasing, as the font isn't quite right, the images aren't centered in the same exact way, the webpage takes up the entire screen instead of being confined to one box, and the page displays correctly on Chrome but not Firefox. Also my knowledge of the use of div's, spans, id's and classes is incomplete, and I did not have enough time to learn them fully, so that some of my HTML code may be seen as inappropriate (using a table instead of a div, for example). However, with the time constraint, I am proud of my ability to have learnt a significant amount of HTML and CSS and to have been able to put together this webpage successfully. The code may not be perfect, but it works.
  
What would you do differently next time?
  Next time I will have had all this experience already under my belt, so that I would start the development with a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS. However next time I would want to produce HTML that functions in a more sophisticated manner.
